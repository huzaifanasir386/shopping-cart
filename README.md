# shopping-cart
A small project i did for the practice of TypeScript

I have used Typescript and i have modularized it to keep the logic and view separate
I have also used LocalStorage to keep the state of cart stored.

To run this project:
-> clone this project
-> Open terminal and navigate to this folder
-> run "npm install"                  // This will install all the dependencies
-> run "npm run dev"                  // To start this project
